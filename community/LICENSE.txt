Licensee agrees not to claim, assert or assist in the claim or assertion of any such license or right disclaimed as provided above.

Without limiting the foregoing, Licensee is responsible for complying with applicable law in connection with use of the Software and verifying and validating the suitability and reliability of the Software for all of Licensee’s use thereof.  Further, Licensee must take prudent steps to protect against failures when the Software or results thereof is incorporated in a system or application, including providing back-up and shut-down mechanisms.

The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall pertain to the Government’s use and disclosure of the software and shall supersede any conflicting contractual terms or conditions.  If this Agreement fails to meet the Government’s needs or is inconsistent in any respect with Federal law, the Government agrees to return the Software, unused, to Orkes.
    Governing Law.  This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of California, U.S.A., applicable to contracts made in full and performed in the State of California, U.S.A., without reference to any conflict of law or choice of law principles that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.

    Waiver.  The failure by either Party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision.

This Agreement contains the complete understanding and agreement of the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter herein.  Any waiver, modification or amendment of any provision of this Agreement shall be effective only if in writing and signed by duly authorized representatives of the Parties.  No inconsistent or additional terms or conditions in any document provided by Licensee, including any purchase orders, purchase agreements, requests for proposals, bills of lading or the like shall apply to this Agreement or the activities hereunder, and any such terms or conditions are hereby rejected.
